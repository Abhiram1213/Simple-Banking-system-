## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of a basic banking system in Python. Users can interact with the system through a console interface.

## Features
- User login with account number and PIN verification.
- Deposit funds into the account.
- Withdraw funds from the account.
- Check account balance.
- Simple text-based interface for ease of use.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the cloned directory.
3. Run the script using the command: `python banking_system.py`.

## Code Explanation
1. `bank_data` Dictionary: Stores account information for users.
2. `login()` Function: Handles user login with account number and PIN verification.
3. `deposit(account_number)` Function: Allows a logged-in user to deposit money into their account.
4. `withdraw(account_number)` Function: Allows a logged-in user to withdraw money from their account.
5. `print_banking_system()` Function: Serves as the main entry point for the banking system.


## Future Improvements
- Implement data persistence using a database to store account information.
- Add error handling to handle invalid user inputs and edge cases.
- Enhance security measures (e.g., hashing PINs) to protect user information.
- Implement additional features such as fund transfers between accounts, account creation, etc.
